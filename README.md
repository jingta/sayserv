# SayServ

Expose the say server on your mac (yes sorry, its mac only..although you could try something like this on ubuntu: http://superuser.com/questions/93691/mac-os-x-say-command-in-ubuntu).


## Installation

1. Have node js installed. 
2. Have mdns installed (for peer discovery) `npm install mdns`
3. Set up to start via launchd or just run with `node sayserv.js`

## Usage

Server will listen on port 1337 by default (just a const in the script)

* /browser - Show all other devices running sayserv on the network
* /:message - Play the given message on the machine
* /:voice/:message - Play the given message on the machine using the given voice
* /broadcast/:voice/:message - Play the given message on all machines on the network running sayserv


### Next

Could randomly assign voices based on hostname?

### Disclamer

Code is messy, feel free to submit pull requests.
